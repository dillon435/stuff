                <p>The main plot resolves around the Covenant invasion of Earth, and the UNSC doing everything they can to defend it. Theres a Covenant ship is the city of New Mombasa, and The Rookie and his team's mission is to drop in on top of the cruiser and destroy it, saving the city. But last second, the ship enters slipspace, and sends a shockwave, sending the ODSTs and their drop pods into a scattered mess. With the city destroyed and the military spread thin, the game starts with The Rookie waking up in his pod, and thus starts his fight to find his squad and get out of the city. The ship left behind plenty of it's own military force, and during the story, a Covenant fleet starts to warp in and destroy the city further. While they're helpless against the fleet, The Rookie and his squad, as he finds them during the story, do anything in their power to stop the Covenant on the ground, and find an escape route for survivors. Eventually, they steal a Covenant dropship, and use it to escape the city, right before the Covenant fleet warps in their capital ship and uses it's cannon to destroy the city for good. As Buck said, "It's like Reach all over again..."</p>
